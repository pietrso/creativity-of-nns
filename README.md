# The Creativity of Neural Networks

The learning procedure (the weight update) of NNs mimics the human behavior. As a matter of fact, as humans learn through their experience, an artificial neural network learns mainly through its previous mistakes. The relationship between humans and machines is a sensible matter. Speaking of this topic, it is natural to wonder if there are still things that can only be achieved by human beings. Some things that can be still considered only humansâ€™ peculiarities can be the creativity and the possibility of dreaming: is it possible for neural networks to identify some connections between something seeing earlier and a "dream"? Is it possible for neural networks to be creative?
To answer these question, this project will explore 2 algorithms: Style Transfer and Deep Dream.
